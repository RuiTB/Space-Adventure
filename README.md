When the player's health reaches zero, he or she is eliminated.

There are power ups that appear randomly in the middle to speed up or slow down your laser, the one with the lightning logo will speed up and the one with the snail will slow down, you can gain those power ups by shooting at them, power ups last for 5 seconds, and power ups respawn every 15-20 seconds. 

All game status is saved in memory, and you can view them in the statistics tab under report. You can view the number of profiles created, the number of games started, the highest score ever gotten, the lowest score ever gotten, the shortest game played, the longest game played, and the total time played.

And you can see all played games from the history tab under report, where you can see who played against who, who won, when it was played, how long it lasted, and how much the winner got scored.
